# Decipher

Here are some decipher java programs I'm working on.

### SubstitutionCipher.java
<p>Uses cryptanalysis to decipher text encrypted using the Subsition Cipher.
 See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">Subsition cipher wiki</a></p>

You will need bigrams.txt and quadgrams.txt from <a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/text-characterisation/quadgrams/">here</a> quadgrams.txt is big and needs to be unziped into the run directory.
Program will report the full path of where it wants these files if they are missing:
File does not exist! C:\Cyptography\programs\decipher\quadgrams.txt
